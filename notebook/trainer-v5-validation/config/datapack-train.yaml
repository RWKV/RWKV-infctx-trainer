  # Configure the deepspeed strategy, we recommend you start with `deepspeed_stage_2_offload` 
  # and adjust from there according to your training needs. `deepspeed_stage_3_offload` is useful  
  # for training LoRA on large models on a single GPU.
  #
  # In general you would want to use the following:
  #
  # - deepspeed_stage_1 : Each of your GPU has too much vram, and you do not know what to do
  #
  # - deepspeed_stage_2 : Optimal distributed training strategy, across multiple gpu each with sufficient vram
  # - deepspeed_stage_2_offload : Reduce vram usage by offloading the optimizer state and work to cpu
  #
  # - deepspeed_stage_3 : Split up the model across multiple gpu, useful for large models, at a performance cost
  # - deepspeed_stage_3_offload : Additional offloading, for even greater performance cost
  #

  # Recommended to be a big enough number (like 128/256) where it prevents the training 
  # loss from flucuating in the process. But not too big of a number where the increased
  # GPU vRAM / offloaded RAM usage will cause the training to crash.

  # You are also recommended to configure this to a large enough number to fully utilize
  # your GPU processing time %, and avoid idle time for the GPU between batches
  #
  # This number is divided by the number of GPUs, and nodes configured
