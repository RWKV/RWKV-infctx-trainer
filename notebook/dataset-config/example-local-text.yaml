## Trainer settings are kept minimal
## with checkpoint / model saving disabled,
## as this tutorial focuses only on datasets
## 
## It only runs 10 steps, enough to prove that
## the dataset configs are valid
##
## See the full `config-example.yaml` for more

data:
  # dataset_path for the prebuilt dataset, using HF `load_from_disk()`
  #
  # Use this if you have built your own dataset and saved it with `save_to_disk()`
  # with source left as null. Other wise configure this to a directory which the 
  # dataset will be built and tokenized by the huggingface dataset process.
  data_path: ../datapath/enwiki8_neox_1024/

  # Other wise provide the source path, which is used as huggingface dataset path
  # this will be used to populate the dataset_path
  #
  # Use either the following
  # - hugging face dataset 
  # - Directory path to a directory containing dataset files
  # - Path to a single dataset file
  # - hugging face dataset mode (ie: text,csv,etc - use data_dir, to configure the path then)
  # - null
  #
  # If source is disabled, all other params, except data_path, is ignored
  source: "text"
  
  # Use data_dir, if you are using source=text/json/etc
  # this should be relative to the trainer script path

  # Tokenizer to use, use either the inbuilt 'neox', or 'neox' tokenizer
  # If using a custom tokenizer, provide the tokenizer file path

  # Rechunking of text dataset, this is done only when source is set as 'text'
  # and will merge the various sentencees, into larger chunks up to the target size

  # This is ignored, if source is not set as text
  # This is ignored, if set to zero
