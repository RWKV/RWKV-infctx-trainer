  # Configure the deepspeed strategy, we recommend you start with `deepspeed_stage_2_offload` 
  # and adjust from there according to your training needs. `deepspeed_stage_3_offload` is useful  
  # for training LoRA on large models on a single GPU.
  #
  # In general you would want to use the following:
  #
  # - deepspeed_stage_1 : Each of your GPU has too much vram, and you do not know what to do
  #
  # - deepspeed_stage_2 : Optimal distributed training strategy, across multiple gpu each with sufficient vram
  # - deepspeed_stage_2_offload : Reduce vram usage by offloading the optimizer state and work to cpu
  #
  # - deepspeed_stage_3 : Split up the model across multiple gpu, useful for large models, at a performance cost
  # - deepspeed_stage_3_offload : Additional offloading, for even greater performance cost
